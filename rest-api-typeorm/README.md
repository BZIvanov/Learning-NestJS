# About this Demo

Demo app with boilerplate code for setting up rest api with TypeORM and Postgresql.

## Notes

Note that in the package.json we set NODE_ENV variable like this `SET NODE_ENV=production&& node dist/main` for Windows. For Linux it would be `NODE_ENV=production && node dist/main`. Make sure to update package.json to correctly set NODE_ENV variable depending your operating system.
