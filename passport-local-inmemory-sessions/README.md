# About this Demo

Here we will see how to work with authentication and sessions.

You can register a new user. Then you can login with it and you can try fetching all posts, which require the user to be logged in.

In this example we are using in memory session. More advanced demo would be to store the sessions using Redis. Storing sessions in memory is not recommended, but this demo is just to learn how sessions work, not to have production ready example.
